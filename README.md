**Python Challenge**: PyBank and PyPoll <br>
**Project Overview**: This Python project, consisting of PyBank and PyPoll, delves into the analysis of financial and election data sets, respectively. The primary aim is to develop Python scripts capable of processing CSV files, performing calculations, and presenting insightful reports.

PyBank PyBank is dedicated to scrutinizing financial records to derive insights into a company's financial performance. The dataset, named budget_data.csv, features "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns. The Python script calculates essential financial metrics including:

1- Total Months
2- Net Total Profit/Losses
3- Average Change in Profit/Losses
4- Greatest Increase in Profits (date and amount)
5- Greatest Decrease in Profits (date and amount)

=> The final analysis is displayed in the terminal and exported to a text file named financial_analysis.txt.

PyPoll PyPoll focuses on modernizing the vote-counting process for a small town. The provided dataset, named election_data.csv, encompasses columns for "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The Python script computes various election-related insights such as:

1- Total Votes Cast
2- List of Candidates Receiving Votes
3- Percentage of Votes Each Candidate Won
4- Total Votes Each Candidate Received
5- Determining the Election Winner Based on Popular Vote

=> The election analysis is showcased in the terminal and saved to a text file named election_results.txt.
